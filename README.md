# landing-page

This is my attempt at The Odin Project's landing page project. It was definitely a challenge
building a page from scratch. I still need some practice with flexbox positioning, and I think
I really need to focus on class selector usage to try and trim down my CSS styling. Overall,
this was pretty fun to work on and very rewarding when things finally started to come together.
